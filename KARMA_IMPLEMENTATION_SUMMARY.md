# Karma Transaction System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive karma transaction logging system that tracks all karma additions and subtractions for teams, ensuring karma is only deducted when it was previously awarded.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Karma Requirements ✅

Players now only qualify for karma bonus when joining a team if **ALL** conditions are met:

- `lookingForTeam: true`
- `paid: true` (fully registered)
- `signed: true` (waiver signed)

**Before:** Only checked `lookingForTeam` status  
**After:** Also requires full registration (paid + signed)

### 2. Transaction Logging ✅

All karma changes are now logged in a subcollection:

```
teams/{teamId}/karma_transactions/{transactionId}
```

Each transaction includes:

- Player and team references
- Amount (+100 or -100)
- Reason ('player_joined' or 'player_left')
- Timestamp
- Season reference

### 3. Smart Karma Removal ✅

When a player leaves a team:

- System checks if there's a matching karma transaction from when they joined
- Only subtracts karma if a transaction exists
- Creates a reversal transaction for audit trail

**Before:** Always subtracted karma if player had `lookingForTeam: true`
**After:** Only subtracts if team was actually awarded karma when player joined

## Files Created

### `Functions/src/shared/karma.ts`

New utility module with helper functions:

- `createKarmaTransaction()` - Logs karma transactions
- `findKarmaTransactionForPlayerJoin()` - Checks if karma was awarded
- `isPlayerFullyRegistered()` - Validates paid + signed status
- `qualifiesForKarmaBonus()` - Checks all karma requirements
- `KARMA_AMOUNT` constant (100)

## Files Modified

### `Functions/src/types.ts`

- Added `KarmaTransaction` interface for subcollection documents

### `Functions/src/functions/teams/managePlayer.ts`

- Updated remove action to query karma transactions before subtracting karma
- Added karma transaction creation when removing players
- Only subtracts karma if matching transaction found
- Enhanced logging to include karma adjustment details

### `Functions/src/triggers/documents/offerUpdated.ts`

- Updated to check full registration status (paid + signed)
- Creates karma transaction when awarding karma
- Only awards karma to fully registered, lookingForTeam players
- Enhanced logging with karma bonus information

## How It Works

### When a Player Joins a Team (via Offer)

1. System checks if player qualifies for karma:
   - `lookingForTeam: true`
   - `paid: true`
   - `signed: true`

2. If qualified:
   - Add +100 karma to team
   - Create transaction record in `teams/{teamId}/karma_transactions/`
   - Transaction includes: player, team, +100, 'player_joined', timestamp, season

3. If not qualified:
   - Add player to roster without karma bonus
   - No transaction created

### When a Player Leaves a Team

1. System queries `karma_transactions` subcollection for this player + season

2. If transaction found (player received karma when joining):
   - Subtract 100 karma (minimum 0)
   - Create reversal transaction with -100 and 'player_left'
   - Log karma adjustment

3. If no transaction found (player never received karma):
   - Remove player from roster
   - No karma subtracted
   - No transaction created

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ Player joins unregistered (not paid/signed) → No karma awarded  
✅ Player joins, then leaves before registering → No karma subtracted  
✅ Player registered but not `lookingForTeam` → No karma awarded/subtracted  
✅ Multiple season transitions → Transactions scoped per season  
✅ Karma never goes below 0

## Testing Recommendations

Test these scenarios:

1. Qualified player (lookingForTeam, paid, signed) joins → +100 karma + transaction
2. Unregistered player joins → 0 karma, no transaction
3. Player without lookingForTeam joins → 0 karma, no transaction
4. Player who received karma leaves → -100 karma + reversal transaction
5. Player who didn't receive karma leaves → 0 karma, no transaction
6. Check transaction subcollections exist and contain correct data
7. Verify karma never goes below 0

## Known Limitations

### Admin Player Updates

The `updatePlayerAdmin` function can manually add/remove players from rosters but doesn't currently track karma transactions. This function would need refactoring to use Firestore transactions for proper karma handling.

**Impact:** Low - Offers are the primary way players join teams

**Future Work:** Refactor admin function to use transactions if karma tracking is needed there

## Migration Notes

### Existing Karma

The system tracks only NEW transactions going forward. Existing team karma values remain unchanged.

### Historical Data

If you want a complete audit trail, you can manually create historical transaction records. The system will work correctly without them - it simply won't subtract karma for players who joined before this update (since there's no transaction to find).

## Deployment Checklist

## Questions Answered

✅ **What defines "fully registered"?**
Both `paid: true` AND `signed: true` for the specific season.

✅ **Track historical karma changes?**
Yes, via `karma_transactions` subcollection under each team.

✅ **Only subtract karma if previously awarded?**
Yes, system checks transaction history before subtracting.

✅ **Collection structure?**
Subcollection under teams: `teams/{teamId}/karma_transactions/`

✅ **When to check registration status?**
At the moment player joins the team (current behavior maintained).

✅ **Karma requirements?**  
`lookingForTeam: true` AND fully registered (`paid: true` + `signed: true`).
