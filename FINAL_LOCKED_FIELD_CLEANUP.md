# Final "locked" Field Cleanup - Complete

## Summary

Successfully removed ALL remaining references to the deprecated "locked" field from code, comments, and documentation.

## Files Modified

### Code Files (3 files)

1. **App/src/types.ts**
   - ✅ Removed `locked: boolean` field from `PlayerSeason` interface
   - ✅ Updated `lookingForTeam` comment to remove "not locked to a registered team" reference

2. **App/src/features/teams/team-profile/team-roster-player.tsx**
   - ✅ Removed `&& !seasonData?.locked` check from `isLookingForTeam` logic
   - ✅ Removed comment about "Locked players are treated as lookingForTeam: false for karma purposes"

3. **App/src/features/home/league-details-section.tsx**
   - ✅ Changed "locked in" to "registered" in user-facing text

### Documentation Files (1 file)

4. **docs/KARMA_AND_PLAYER_LOCKING_FEATURE.md → docs/ARCHIVED_KARMA_AND_PLAYER_LOCKING_FEATURE.md**
   - ✅ Renamed to indicate archived status
   - ✅ Added deprecation notice at top pointing to current documentation
   - ✅ Marked as historical reference only

## Verification

### Build Status

- ✅ Functions build: SUCCESS (`npm run build` in Functions/)
- ✅ App build: SUCCESS (`npm run build` in App/)

### Code Search

- ✅ No "locked" references in `App/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
- ✅ No "locked" references in `Functions/src/**/*.ts`

## Current State

The system now exclusively uses the `lookingForTeam` field for all logic:

- **Karma qualification**: Player must have `lookingForTeam: true` AND be fully registered (paid + signed)
- **Karma transactions**: Tracked in subcollections to prevent unfair deductions
- **No locked field**: Removed entirely from types, logic, and UI

## Related Documentation

For current karma system implementation, see:

- [KARMA_TRANSACTION_SYSTEM.md](/docs/KARMA_TRANSACTION_SYSTEM.md)
- [KARMA_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](/KARMA_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [LOCKED_FIELD_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md](/LOCKED_FIELD_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy updated Functions to Firebase
2. ✅ Deploy updated App to hosting
3. Test karma calculations with simplified logic
4. (Optional) Clean up existing `locked` fields from Firestore documents

**Cleanup Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All "locked" references removed from codebase
