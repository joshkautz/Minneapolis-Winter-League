# TODO:

Allow players to include messages in their team requests so they can have a better chance of joining a team.
Add a karma mechanism so teams can get more karma by allowing individuals onto their team.
Add a flag to teams that indicates that they're looking for more players, so individuals weel welcome to request to join them.
Add a mechanism so teams with the most karma have priority seeding for our already established seeding format, rather than going randomly (which was prviously alphabetically)
