# Shared Library Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated from a shared library approach to project-specific type definitions due to incompatibilities between Firebase Admin SDK (Functions) and Firebase Client SDK (App).

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Project-Specific Types

#### App Project (`App/src/types.ts`)

- Created types using Firebase Client SDK (`firebase/firestore`)
- Includes all document interfaces: `PlayerDocument`, `TeamDocument`, `SeasonDocument`, etc.
- Uses `DocumentReference` from Firebase Client SDK

#### Functions Project (`Functions/src/types.ts`)

- Created types using Firebase Admin SDK (`firebase-admin/firestore`)
- Same interfaces but with Admin SDK types
- Uses `DocumentReference` from Firebase Admin SDK

### 2. Created Project-Specific Validation

#### App Project (`App/src/validation.ts`)

- Type guards and validation utilities for client-side types
- Imports from local `./types`

#### Functions Project (`Functions/src/validation.ts`)

- Type guards and validation utilities for server-side types
- Imports from local `./types.js` (with explicit extension for Node.js)

### 3. Updated Import Statements

#### App Project

- Updated `App/src/shared/utils/interfaces.ts` to import from local types
- Fixed all component imports from `@minneapolis-winter-league/shared` to use local types
- Updated Firebase adapter to use client SDK types consistently

#### Functions Project

- Updated all function imports to use relative paths to local types
- Fixed import extensions for Node.js compatibility (`.js`)

### 4. Fixed Type Issues

- Corrected malformed `PlayerSeason` objects in Firebase collection operations
- Fixed `captain` field assignments that were incorrectly using `item.team`
- Removed unused imports and type references

### 5. Package Configuration

- Removed `@minneapolis-winter-league/shared` dependency from both App and Functions
- Updated root workspace configuration to exclude Shared package
- Updated build scripts to only build App and Functions

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Each project now uses types that exactly match its Firebase SDK
2. **No Type Conflicts**: Eliminated conflicts between Admin and Client SDK types
3. **Simpler Dependencies**: No cross-package dependencies to manage
4. **Better Maintainability**: Types are co-located with the code that uses them

## Files Modified

### App Project

- `src/types.ts` (new)
- `src/validation.ts` (new)
- `src/shared/utils/interfaces.ts`
- `src/firebase/timestamp-adapter.ts`
- `src/firebase/collections/players.ts`
- `src/firebase/collections/teams.ts`
- Multiple component files with import updates
- `package.json`

### Functions Project

- `src/types.ts` (new)
- `src/validation.ts` (new)
- All function files with import updates
- `package.json`

### Root Project

- `package.json`

## Shared Package Removal

✅ **COMPLETED**: The Shared package has been completely removed from the project since both App and Functions now have their own type definitions that are compatible with their respective Firebase SDKs.

### Final Project Structure

```
Minneapolis-Winter-League/
├── App/                    # React frontend with Client SDK types
├── Functions/              # Firebase Functions with Admin SDK types
├── docs/                   # Documentation
├── firebase.json
├── package.json            # Root workspace (App + Functions only)
└── README.md
```

The project is now simplified with only two workspaces (App and Functions) and no problematic cross-dependencies.
