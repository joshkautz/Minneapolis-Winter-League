## Error Boundary Implementation

I've successfully implemented comprehensive error handling for the PlayerRankingsAdmin component:

### 1. **ErrorBoundary Component** (`/src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`)

- Class-based React error boundary that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree
- Displays user-friendly error messages instead of crashing the application
- Shows detailed error information in development mode
- Provides "Try Again" and "Reload Page" buttons for recovery
- Supports custom error callbacks for logging to external services

### 2. **Route-Level Error Boundary** (`/src/routes/app-routes.tsx`)

- Wrapped the PlayerRankingsAdmin route with the ErrorBoundary
- Added error logging callback for debugging
- Positioned to catch any errors within the admin component

### 3. **Defensive Programming in PlayerRankingsAdmin**

- Added try-catch blocks around data processing logic
- Safe date formatting functions with error handling
- Null-safe operators for optional data
- Error handling in the sorting logic
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Key Improvements:

- **Error Recovery**: Users can retry failed operations without page reload
- **Better UX**: Informative error messages instead of blank screens
- **Developer Experience**: Detailed error information in development mode
- **Robustness**: Multiple layers of error protection

### Error Boundary Features:

- üõ°Ô∏è **Catches React errors** before they crash the app
- üîÑ **Recovery options** with "Try Again" and "Reload Page" buttons
- üìù **Detailed logging** for development and debugging
- üé® **Consistent UI** matching your existing design system
- ‚ö° **Performance-aware** with minimal overhead

The error boundary will now catch any JavaScript errors that occur in the PlayerRankingsAdmin component and display a user-friendly error message instead of showing a broken page or console errors that users can't understand.
