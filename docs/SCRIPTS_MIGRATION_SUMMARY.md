# üîÑ Scripts Directory Migration - Summary

## What Was Changed

### ‚ùå Removed

- **Entire `Scripts/` directory** - All legacy migration and utility scripts
- **All script dependencies** - node_modules, package.json from Scripts directory

### ‚úÖ Added

#### Firebase Emulator Seed Data (`emulator-data/`)

- `auth_export.json` - Pre-configured test users
- `firestore_export.json` - Complete sample database
- `README.md` - Documentation for seed data

#### Root Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "emulators:start": "firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,storage",
  "emulators:start:seed": "firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,storage --import ./emulator-data",
  "emulators:export": "firebase emulators:export ./emulator-data",
  "emulators:clear": "rm -rf ./emulator-data && mkdir ./emulator-data",
  "dev:setup": "firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,storage --import ./emulator-data"
}
```

## New Development Workflow

### Start Development

```bash
# Start emulators with test data
npm run emulators:start:seed

# In another terminal - run the app
cd App && npm run dev:emulators
```

### Manage Test Data

```bash
# Export current emulator state
npm run emulators:export

# Start fresh (no data)
npm run emulators:start

# Clear all data
npm run emulators:clear
```

## Benefits of New Approach

### ‚úÖ Firebase Best Practices

- Uses official Firebase import/export format
- No custom scripts to maintain
- Leverages built-in emulator features

### ‚úÖ Reliability

- Data loads instantly on emulator start
- No network dependencies or connection issues
- Consistent, repeatable test environment

### ‚úÖ Simplicity

- Single command to start with data
- No separate seeding process required
- JSON files are easy to understand and modify

### ‚úÖ Performance

- Data loads in milliseconds vs seconds
- No need to wait for async operations
- Immediate development environment

## Test Data Included

### Users (Authentication)

- 3 Captains: captain1-3@test.com
- 4 Players: player1-4@test.com
- All emails verified, ready to use

### Firestore Collections

- **seasons**: Test season with dates
- **teams**: 3 teams (Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- **players**: 7 players with various statuses
- **games**: Sample games (completed & upcoming)

### Real-World Scenarios

- Players assigned to teams
- Unassigned free agents
- Mixed payment/waiver statuses
- Completed games with scores
- Upcoming scheduled games

## Migration Complete ‚úÖ

The project now uses Firebase-native seeding approach, eliminating:

- Custom Node.js scripts
- Firebase Admin SDK dependencies for seeding
- Complex async seeding logic
- Network reliability issues

Development environment is now faster, more reliable, and follows Firebase best practices.
